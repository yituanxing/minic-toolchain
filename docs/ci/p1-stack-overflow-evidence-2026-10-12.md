# MiniC Linux 6.6.143 P1 stack overflow: measured evidence (2026-10-12)

## Reproducible evidence

The frozen all-MiniC Image `d1a0f9f67cb0dcb6ee6229abed2409e1c454de5074f6e8a752d3dfe004c85e98` failed P1 all three times. With **the same exact mixed Image** `e02b6335582a6083b6d05080caed0ff09e08e084526cfae96468e050877f9490`, replacing only `net/ipv6/ip6_output.o` with GCC produced PASS, PASS, FAIL. Thus a one-owner GCC result is **not** a stable rescue. Runs: 38224538679.

QEMU's actual RISC-V GDB stub (run 38226446563) measured the following chronological stack pointers in PID 39 on the failing IPv6 TCP path. The 16 KiB task stack is `ff200000001c8000..ff200000001cc000`.

| Entry function | SP | Bytes above stack bottom |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `tcp_v6_connect` | `ff200000001cb870` | 14448 |
| `__tcp_transmit_skb` | `ff200000001cb280` | 12928 |
| `ip6_xmit` | `ff200000001cabb0` | 11184 |
| `ip6_output` | `ff200000001ca1a0` | 8608 |
| `ip6_finish_output2` | `ff200000001c9bb0` | 7088 |

An exception then reported the task SP at `ff200000001c8060`, **only 96 bytes from stack bottom**. These measurements are precise entry/exception samples, not a complete call graph, and do not alone prove which backend optimization is safe.

Runtime profile frame analysis (run 38223454312): `ip6_finish_output2` 4064 B (SSA slots 72 B), `ip6_xmit` 2288 B (SSA 72 B). The dominant frame footprint is not SSA storage.

## Rejected experiment

Run 38227315248 reenabled **cross-basic-block CoreObject stack-slot reuse** for `net/ipv6/ip6_output.o` as a strictly opt-in one-owner experiment. It reduced `ip6_finish_output2` from 4064 B to 1872 B, `ip6_xmit` from 2288 B to 1152 B; however the identical Image FAILED P1 all three times, often with the SP far **outside** the task stack (`ff1fffffffffffe0`). The 2026-10-01 cross-block safety hotfix must remain in force. **Do not promote the unsafe slot reuse.** This document records the failed hypothesis so it is not retried without new proof.

## Next controlled step

**Confirmed mixed rescue:** CI **#38228441365** restored the authenticated frozen 2064-object universe, replaced only `net/ipv6/ip6_output.o`, `net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.o`, `net/ipv4/tcp_output.o`, and `net/core/dev.o` with GCC objects, then GNU linked a single Image of SHA-256 `c6c3456b59fcd4ce3dde6ff0e44e0fe98a5670b657500a8ad1564760537f23d0`. The same Image passed the full P1 Python-era 12-syscall contract on **three consecutive independent QEMU boots** (PASS/PASS/PASS). The all-2064-MiniC control Image failed P1 in that job. This establishes a reproducible **2060-MiniC + 4-GCC object workaround**, **not** a fully MiniC-certified compiler.

Next reduce the 4-GCC rescue set by controlled A/B before deciding where to optimize safe CoreObject lifetime/stack allocation. An unverified or unsafe cross-block stack-coloring shortcut must never be promoted merely because it makes one P1 run pass.

## Exact four-way 3-GCC minimization — completed

CI **#38237171824**: every row below uses one unique SHA-pinned Image
booted independently three times. The all-MiniC (2064) control also FAILed
in the same run. Every other C owner outside the three GCC replacements
remained an attested, frozen MiniC object.

| Restored MiniC object | 3 remaining GCC owners | P1 results |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `net/ipv6/ip6_output.o` | `tcp_ipv6.o`, `tcp_output.o`, `dev.o` | **FAIL / FAIL / FAIL** |
| `net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.o` | `ip6_output.o`, `tcp_output.o`, `dev.o` | PASS / PASS / PASS |
| `net/ipv4/tcp_output.o` | `ip6_output.o`, `tcp_ipv6.o`, `dev.o` | PASS / PASS / PASS |
| `net/core/dev.o` | `ip6_output.o`, `tcp_ipv6.o`, `tcp_output.o` | PASS / PASS / PASS |

The failed three-GCC Image, when MiniC compiled `ip6_output.o`, sometimes
panicked with SP around `0xff1fffffffffffe0`, far below the expected task
stack. **The evidence shows `ip6_output.o` is necessary to keep as GCC in
these tested three-GCC configurations, not that it necessarily contains the
sole compiler bug.** The other three owner swaps are each individually
unnecessary within the original four-object workaround, and may still
interact with each other.

The next exact experiment tests the three *two*-GCC subsets, each retaining
`net/ipv6/ip6_output.o` and one of
`tcp_ipv6.o`, `tcp_output.o`, `dev.o`. Each distinct Image must PASS
P1 three times, with object/assembly/link provenance unchanged, before it
can be treated as the smaller workaround.
