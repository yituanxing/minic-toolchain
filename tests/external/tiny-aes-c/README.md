# tiny-AES-c external frontier

This directory tracks the first independently maintained upstream project used to drive MiniC.

## Upstream identity

- Repository: `kokke/tiny-AES-c`
- Commit: `23856752fbd139da0b8ca6e471a13d5bcc99a08d`
- License: Unlicense (`unlicense.txt`)
- Initial configuration: AES-128 ECB only (`ECB=1`, `CBC=0`, `CTR=0`)

Pinned Git blob identities:

| File | Git blob SHA-1 |
|---|---|
| `aes.c` | `4481f7b24ec964019d38669842913fd571d28ba3` |
| `aes.h` | `b29b6683549632676ec11c06eb86efd02964db57` |
| `unlicense.txt` | `68a49daad8ff7e35068f2b7a97d643aab440eaec` |

## Rules

1. The downloaded upstream files are not edited for MiniC.
2. The RISC-V GCC preprocessor remains outside the compiler-under-test boundary.
3. Small target-environment shim headers may define standard integer names while native system headers remain outside the active subset.
4. The probe verifies every upstream Git blob before preprocessing.
5. The expected frontier advances only after the previous capability has a production implementation and permanent focused coverage.
6. Completion requires the pinned AES-128 ECB core and a test-vector harness to pass the GCC/MiniC differential oracle without MiniC-specific source patches.

## Current frontier

MiniC now passes the upstream declarations, `struct AES_ctx`, typed and `const` prototypes, multidimensional typedef arrays, static read-only lookup tables, static internal functions, and `void` definitions.

The exact pinned failure is the first `unsigned` local declaration inside `KeyExpansion`, currently surfaced as an undeclared local at the verified preprocessed location.

This probe is intentionally a moving frontier, not an execution acceptance test. Once the upstream core compiles, it must be replaced by assembly/linking and a real AES-128 ECB differential execution harness.
